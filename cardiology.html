    <h4>CORONARY ANGIOGRAM</h4>
        <p>During coronary angiography, a small catheter or tube is inserted through the skin into an artery in the groin or the Hand. Through a special x-ray viewing instrument, the catheter is moved to the opening of the coronary arteries which supply blood to the heart. A small amount of solution containing iodine is injected into each artery. The images that are produced are called the angiogram which accurately reveals the blockages.
        Depending on the severity of the blockage in the artery, our experts prescribe the insertion of a stent during the angiography itself. A stent supports the artery walls to prevent them from narrowing again after the angioplasty. Our cardiologists at SL Hospitals are highly proficient in performing a stent procedure that requires a fine eye for detail, assisted with high precision instruments with a patient’s comfort as the priority.
