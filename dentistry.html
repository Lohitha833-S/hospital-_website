<h4>DENTAL STERLIZER</h4>
   <p> department of dentistry are now using autoclaving machines which are a dental sterilizer that processes instruments faster and more effectively than ever before. In autoclaving, instruments (which are first cleaned, dried, and placed in a special steam-penetrable wrap), are subjected to pressurized steam for 15 to 20 minutes. All instruments are autoclaved in special sealed sterilization pouches, and opened just prior to treatment.

    The water used in our dental lines is distilled water. These lines are routinely checked by our Technical experts and a report of it is duly signed and submitted to the Head Quality Control Committee on a routine basis.
